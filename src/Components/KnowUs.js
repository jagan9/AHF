In our Country we have so many intelligent mind's and experienced persons But country is still facing problems and still as Developing Nation. So ,we have to think once what Energy Country need for Freedom and That Army is only Youth. Because experienced persons not changed our Nation and they are not our Strength. The Nation's Strength is 60% of it's population and That is Our Youth. Unfortunately, Youth were divided as Caste, Religion, Political organization's. In fact they were divided by some Pseudo Leaders for their benefits and made youth as followers to shout slogans, to shout Jindabaad only. So, We should observe one thing, Our Countries strength also divided which is under selfish People. The Bharath needs An Army,An Internal Army, An Youth Army to secure Nation from Pseudo Leaders. Unlike Jindabaad followers, We Should Make Every Youth A Leader and Unite Youth As An Army in a systematic way, disciplinary manner Irrespective of Theirs Caste, Religion, Political organization's. For that Work only *Azad Hind Fauz* re-established To make Every Youth A Leader. Actually Azad Hind Fauz is established on *October 21st 1943* for Undivided India's (Hindustan) Freedom from Foreigners who are reasoned for our problems. Luckily we got freedom from reasoned persons on 15th August 1947 but not get freedom from problems which are still continuing by our Pseudo Leaders. And Azad Hind Fauz disestablished on August 18th 1945 on the day of Netaji's missing. To Fulfill Ambitions of Our great Ancestors, freedom fighters, *AZAD HIND FAUZ* was Re-established on February 19th 2021 In Sardar Patel College, Secunderabad, Hyderabad.<br/>
